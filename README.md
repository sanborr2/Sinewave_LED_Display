# Sinewave_LED_Display
This was a project I did in Embedded Microcontrollers I during Winter 2018 at Western Washington University using a FRDM-K22F 
Embedded Microcontroller. The code is written in the assembly language for a Cortex M4 known as Thumb-2. The point of the program was
to utilize the 8 LEDs of the FDRM board and create a lighting effect where one LED would be turned on at a time but the light would
appear to move across the LEDs because an adjacent light would turn on as the current light would turn off. The frequency could be set via 
the manual switches on the board or using a keyboard with the input fed from a terminal to the UART on the microcontroller.
